Responsive Web Layout with CSS Grid and Tailwind CSS

This project demonstrates a responsive web layout built using a combination of CSS Grid for the main structural layout and Tailwind CSS for component-level styling and utility.

Objective:

The objective was to create a fully responsive web page that adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, with CSS Grid as the primary layout system for major sections.

Technologies Used:

HTML5: For semantic content structure.

CSS Grid: For the main page layout (header, main, footer) and key sections (navigation, hero, features).

Tailwind CSS (CDN): For utility-first styling of individual components (colors, spacing, typography, shadows, hover effects, etc.).

Google Fonts: For 'Inter' font and 'Material Symbols Outlined' icons.

Font Awesome (CDN): For social media or other general icons.

Features:

Fully Responsive: Layout adapts to different screen sizes.

CSS Grid Driven: Main layout achieved using display: grid and media queries.

Semantic HTML: Uses appropriate HTML5 elements for structure.

Modern CSS Practices: Clean, organized CSS with clear separation of concerns.

Efficient Styling: Leverages Tailwind CSS utilities for rapid and consistent component styling.

Setup Instructions:

To run this project locally, simply follow these steps:

Save the files:

Save the HTML code provided above as index.html.

Save the CSS code provided above as styles.css in the same directory as index.html.

Open index.html: Double-click the index.html file in your web browser.

That's it! The page should load and be responsive.

Code Explanation:

index.html:

Includes the <meta name="viewport"> tag for proper responsiveness.

Links to styles.css for custom CSS Grid rules.

Loads the Tailwind CSS CDN for utility classes.

Loads Google Fonts for 'Inter' (the main font) and 'Material Symbols Outlined' (for the menu icon).

The main-layout-container div uses display: grid in styles.css to define the overall structure (header, main content, footer).

Sections like nav-grid, hero-content-grid, and features-grid also utilize display: grid in styles.css to manage their internal layouts.

Tailwind classes are still used extensively for visual styling (e.g., text-2xl, bg-white, rounded-lg, shadow-lg, px-4, py-8, hover effects).

styles.css:

Defines the primary grid containers (.main-layout-container, .nav-grid, .hero-content-grid, .features-grid).

Uses grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to define column and row structures.

Employs media queries (@media (min-width: 640px) and @media (min-width: 1024px)) to adjust the grid layouts for tablet and desktop breakpoints. This includes changing the number of columns, showing/hiding navigation elements, and adjusting gaps.

Includes basic font-family settings and root variables for colors for maintainability.

Responsive Breakpoints:

Mobile (default):

Navigation: Logo on left, mobile menu button on right. Navigation links and desktop button are hidden.

Hero Section: Content stacked in a single column.

Features Section: Cards stacked in a single column.

Tablet (min-width: 640px):

Features Section: Cards arranged in two columns.

Desktop (min-width: 1024px):

Navigation: Logo, full navigation links, and "Get Started" button are all visible in a three-column grid. Mobile menu button is hidden.

Hero Section: Content and image are arranged side-by-side in a two-column grid.

Features Section: Cards arranged in three columns.
